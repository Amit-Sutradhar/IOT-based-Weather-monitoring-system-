# IOT-based-Weather-monitoring-system-
in this project we will learn  how to make IOT based weather monitoring system

In this project we will use verious type of sensors like 
- DHT11 to measure humidity 
- MQ135 to measure Air_Quality 
- BMP180 to measure altitude/pressure/temprature 

and we will use Thingspeak colude to upload the data on colude, and we also use one oled display to see the data ...
